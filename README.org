* TranscriptTool API Server
The =TranscriptTool= API Server is implemented in [[https://kotlinlang.org/][Kotlin]] and runs on the [[https://ktor.io/][ktor]] server framework. The API Server distributes transcription tasks to registers users and collects completed transcriptions (and how they were built up over time) from users of the [[https://github.com/unmute-tech/transcripttool][TranscriptTool]] app.

** Setup
The [[build.gradle.kts][build.gradle.kts]] file contains build configurations to build, both a fat JAR of the API server as well as a dockerized version of the application.

The [[docker-compose.yml]] file illustrates how the application can be deployed.  Users register and are authenticated through [[https://ktor.io/docs/jwt.html][JSON Web Tokens (JWT)]], and we recommend that the deployment is accessed through the https protocol. A reverse proxy, such as [[https://www.nginx.com/][nginx]] or [[https://traefik.io/traefik/][traefik]], is the easiest way of achieving this.
